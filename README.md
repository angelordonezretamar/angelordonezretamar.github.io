# My Web CV Github Repo
a repo for my Web CV that is hosted using github pages
I made the Web CV so that I could link it on my resume and show more projects that did not fit on my resume
It was also a fun project to do in tandem with design 6 and building a google pages site for our team project
If you are a recruiter, I hope you enjoyed it
If you are a regular person, your opinion on it does not really matter as much.

Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
