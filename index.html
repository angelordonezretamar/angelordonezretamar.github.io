      that is able to actively reconfigure itself when nodes become unresponsive or the network is attacked with no human intervention needed.

      hospital, while healthcare professionals access real-time data remotely. At just $20 per unit, SmartVital significantly reduces hospital costs 
      compared to conventional $10,000 wired systems, offering an innovative and affordable solution for modern healthcare.

<!-- ABOUT ME -->
<div class="summary">
  <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am the sixth of eight children. I have 21 nieces and nephews as of now but that number grows quite often! I was born in Madrid, Spain. I moved to New Jersey when I was three years old so I have the benefit of being fluent in both languages and having no accent in either. My mother is also one of eight and my large extended family, as well as one of my sisters and her family, live in Spain. I still love to play soccer and tennis and stay fit by going to the gym. My favorite soccer team is Atlético de Madrid and my favorite tennis players are the Spanish ones, currently Alcaraz. I also support the Spanish national teams and enjoy seeing Spanish players succeed around the world in any leagues, and any sports.
