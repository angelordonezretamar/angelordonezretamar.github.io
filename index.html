          as well as one of my sisters and her family, live in Spain. I still love to play soccer and tennis and stay fit
          by going to the gym. My favorite soccer team is Atlético de Madrid and my favorite tennis players are the Spanish
          ones, currently Alcaraz. I also support the Spanish national teams and enjoy seeing Spanish players
          succeed around the world in any leagues, and any sports.
